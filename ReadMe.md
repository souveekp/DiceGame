This is a simple 2 player CLI based dice game. 

To run simply download the project and compile the DiceGame.java file.

Make sure you open the command prompt with the same directory where you have saved the project.

--> javac DiceGame.java 

After that execute --> java DiceGame. I am adding some text here so that I can use the git diff tool and see how that works.
